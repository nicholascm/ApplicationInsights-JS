# Microsoft Application Insights JavaScript SDK - React Native Plugin

React Native Plugin for the Application Insights Javascript SDK

## Getting Started
>**This plugin relies on [`react-native-device-info`](https://github.com/rebeccahughes/react-native-device-info). You must install and link this package. Keep `react-native-device-info` up-to-date to collect the latest device names using your app.**


```zsh
npm install --save @microsoft/applicationinsights-react-native @microsoft/applicationinsights-web
npm install --save react-native-device-info
react-native link react-native-device-info
```


## Initializing the Plugin 
To use this plugin, you only need to construct the plugin and add it as an `extension` to your existing Application Insights instance.
```ts
import { ApplicationInsights } from '@microsoft/applicationinsights-web';
import { ReactNativePlugin } from '@microsoft/applicationinsights-react-native';

// for standard/bare/ejected RN apps  "react-native-device-info"
// react-native-device-info can provide all the needed information
let RNPlugin = new ReactNativePlugin({
    deviceInfo: {
        getUniqueId: DeviceInfo.getUniqueId; // Installation ID,
        getDeviceType: DeviceInfo.getDeviceType,
        getModel: DeviceInfo.getModel
    }
});

// for Expo apps
// Recommend to use expo-device and expo-constants dependencies

let RNPlugin = new ReactNativePlugin({
  deviceInfo: {
    getUniqueId: () => Constants.deviceId,
    getDeviceType: () => Device.modelId,
    getModel: () => Device.modelName
  }
});


let appInsights = new ApplicationInsights({
    config: {
        instrumentationKey: 'YOUR_INSTRUMENTATION_KEY_GOES_HERE',
        extensions: [RNPlugin]
    }
});

appInsights.loadAppInsights();
```
